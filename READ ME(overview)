Code Overview:

The project is organized around a custom ROS 2 package called irrigation_bot, which defines the robot’s hardware, simulation world, and spawn behavior. Here's what each major component does:

urdf/irrigation_bot.urdf

    Describes the robot's physical structure in XML format.

    Includes:

        Base link

        Four wheels (2 added manually)

        Visual and collision elements

        Joint definitions for mobility

        Custom black material color for the robot

 worlds/irrigation_world.sdf

    Defines a custom simulation environment (farmland scene).

    Designed to include gray-colored areas that represent dry land.

    Compatible with Gazebo Harmonic for smooth spawning and interaction.

 spawn.launch.py (optional/custom launch file)

    ROS 2 launch script to:

        Load the URDF model

        Use robot_state_publisher

        Spawn the robot into Gazebo

        Can be expanded for sensors and control nodes

 ROS Integration

    Currently a static robot but prepared for expansion:

        Add sensors like cameras or lidar

        Connect controllers or navigation stack (Nav2)

        Integrate custom Python nodes for irrigation behavior

Future Plans:

    Add camera and image processing to detect dry areas dynamically

    Integrate navigation stack (Nav2)

    Implement autonomous irrigation routine

    Simulate real-time water dispersion effect
